## My process

I started by creating a large grid within the body element with 3 rows and a single column. Then subsequently dived the rows into columns and rows according to the page layout then proceeded to stle the components to match the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I better understood the grid layout and how to plan content around them.
I learnt how to cover a grid container with an image.
I learnt how to style a (hr) element in a grid box so that it can appear as single line.
I learnt how to letter space and style a button.


Some of the CSS I am proud of:
```css
.main-image>img {
    object-fit: cover;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

Areas I would like to continue perfecting are in flexbox and grid containers.
